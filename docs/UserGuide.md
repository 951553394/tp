# easyLog User Guide

Welcome to the user guide of **easyLog**! <br>

Are you a home-based business owner tired of using a pen and paper to keep track of your inventory? Do you have limited
budget investing in a new system to manage your business? Fret not, easyLog, our cross-platform<sup>1</sup> logistic
management application will get you covered! It is the application to boost your productivity when it comes to managing
your items and orders and best of all, it is free! Primarily, the current version of easyLog allows you to add new items
and orders , view existing items and orders, remove specific items and orders and clear all existing items and orders in
the inventory at ease. You can also generate a receipt for your customer and view which item generate most number of
sales.

easyLog is highly optimized for home-based business owners like you via a carefully designed Command Line Interface
(CLI); this means that you will run the application by typing commands into a command terminal<sup>2</sup>. If you type
fast, easyLog can get logistic management tasks done more easily and significantly more efficiently than traditional
Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications while still having the benefits of GUI; GUI applications allow users to
interact with the application through visuals such as buttons, at the expense of lower precision and slower speed as
compared to CLI.

If this sounds great to you, we encourage you to visit [1. Quick start](#1-quick-start) to learn how to manage your
business using easyLog.

## 1. Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest easyLog.jar from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-T09-4/tp/releases/v2.0).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your easyLog.
4. Open up a terminal/command window at the location where easyLog.jar is located.
5. Run the command `java -jar easyLog.jar`
6. The app should load as shown below

```
                       _                 
                      | |

7. Type a command and press enter to continue using the app.
8. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## 2. Features

Section 2 will explain the features available in easyLog.

###### Notes about the command format:

* Any word in UPPER_CASE is a parameter to be entered by the user (e.g., in `add n/CUSTOMER_NAME`, `CUSTOMER_NAME` is a
  parameter and a valid command can be `add n/Alice Tan`).

* Any extraneous parameters for commands not taking in any single parameter (such as `help` and `exit`) will not be
  ignored. However, any leading and trailing whitespaces will be neglected. This means, for instance, `  help  ` will
  trigger [2.1 viewing help: `help`](#21-viewing-help-help) command whereas `help me` will not be understood by easyLog
  (i.e., easyLog will show it does not understand your command).

* ðŸ’¡ refers to a tip which contain important information such as what the range of valid inputs are.

#### 2.3.2. Add an order: `orders add`

When receiving an order from your customer, `orders add` feature allows you to input the details of the order from your
customer into the easyLog app and allows you to manage your orders. (Further features to manage orders will be explained
in future sections.)

Steps to add an order in easyLog:
1. Input `orders add <customer_name>` command
2. You will be prompted to key in the item number and quantity to be added to the order.
3. Input in this format`<item_number> <space> <item_quantity>` for items to be added to the order.
4. Repeat step 3 if there are more items to be added into the order.
5. Input `stop` to stop adding items to the order.
6. Order details will then be added into the system.

Note:
1. Order has to contain at least 1 item to be added into the system.
2. Item quantity to be inputted into the order cannot be more than the current stock in the inventory.
3. Item quantity for each item inputted into the order would be removed from the inventory stock of that item 
   and tracked separately. The quantity would only be returned and added back to the inventory count for that item
   if the order is not done and deleted.
4. While adding items into the order, if the app encounters any format error in the input, it may cause order details to
   be added wrongly. Do use [`orders delete`](#234-remove-an-order-orders-delete) feature to delete the order and
   re-input the order details in the correct format.
5. When in doubt, do follow the prompts shown on command terminal.

### 2.4. Storage

Section 2.4 will explain storage related features.

#### 2.4.1. Load, create and save data

While initializing easyLog, it automatically looks for an available save file to load so that you can continue your
progress from the previous exit. If there are no save file available to load, easyLog will automatically create a save
file for you and save your data and information when exiting the app. The save file will be named as `easyLog.txt` and 
will be located in the same folder/directory as the easyLog app.

The save file can be copied to another machine and placed in the same folder/directory that contains the easyLog app. Do
take note that only one `easyLog.txt` should be in the directory or there would be an error. This transfer of save file
allows you to work on multiple devices if you choose to do so.

It is not recommended that you manipulate/edit the data in `easyLog.txt`. However, if you are an expert user and confident,
do feel free to manipulate the data in `easyLog.txt` manually if it enhances your workflow.

#### 2.4.2. Generate receipts

When [`orders done`](#238-update-the-status-of-an-order-orders-done) feature is executed, a receipt will be 
automatically generated that contains the order details that was deleted. The generated receipts can be found in the 
same directory as the location of the easyLog app inside a `Receipts` folder. The receipts generated will be in a `.txt` 
format. This allows the list of orders while using the app to be kept clean with only the orders that are not done for
easier viewing. Also, the generated receipts allows you to keep track of your revenue or to handle your taxes.
Furthermore, receipts are numbered to show you how many orders you have fulfilled.

![Receipt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60378963/113499419-7b13a100-9548-11eb-80eb-35e9cb2aeb5f.jpg)

### 2.5. Exit the program: `exit`

Exit the app.

Format: `exit`

Expected Output:

```
exit (users input)
____________________________________________________________
Save data saved.
____________________________________________________________
Bye. Thanks for using easyLog!
____________________________________________________________
```

## 3. FAQ

**Q1**: I do not seem to be able to add an item. Why is this so?

> There could be many possibilities which can result in you not being able to add an item. We advise you to follow
> the below steps when intending to add an item. <br/>
>
> Please note that you need to specify the description of the item. For instance, you can do this
> by typing `orders add n/Competitive Programming 4: The Lower Bound of Programming Contests in the 2020s`. <br/>
>
> After that, input the **price per item** *(unit price)*. Please note that the unit price is either zero (free item) or
> a positive number smaller or equal to 1000000000 (the system currently accepts a unit price not more than
> SG$1,000,000,000). For example, you can enter `p/100` for the item price field. <br/>
>
> Lastly, please provide number of items to be added, also known as stock. (TO BE REVISED)

**Q2**: I do not seem to be able to add an order. Why is this so?

> There could be many possibilities which can result in you not being able to add an order. We advise you to follow
> the below steps when intending to add an order. <br/>
>
> Please note that you need to specify a customer's name as he or she is the one whom the order of interest will be
> sent to. For instance, you can do this by typing `orders add n/Alice`. <br/>
>
> After that, input the item number found in the item list (if unsure, simply type `items list` to check). Please
> separate each item number by exactly one empty space (i.e., ` `). Do not attempt to enter an item number
> which does not exist in the item list or belongs to another order. For example, you could type `1 2`, provided
> the first and second items exist in the item list and are not added to other orders.

**Q3**: I am scared that I input any command which I do not intend to execute. Is there a way to revert changes in the
system?

> If you input any invalid command (e.g., an unrecognized command or a clearing command for the item list when the list
> is already empty), it will not be executed. <br/>
>
> In the event that you accidentally add an item or order, you can always undo it by deleting it. Likewise, you can
> add an item or order back if you delete it mistakenly. For now, easyLog does not have a command to revert any
> changes. We may consider adding it in the upcoming version. <br/>
>
> You should not worry too much as easyLog is highly optimized for fast typists working in a warehouse like you.

**Q4**: Why does easyLog only allow me to enter additional stock number when I add an item which already exists in the
> system? Why cannot I update the unit price?

> It is typically hard for users to remember all items in the system. Hence, we make it easier and more efficient when
> easyLog detects the item to be added already exists in the item list. Since this only happens when the user stocks up
> a particular item, we allow the user to increase the stock as long as the total number of item stock is within the
> threshold (i.e., 1000000). However, it does not naturally happen when a user wants to update the unit price when he or
> she adds an item which already exists in the system.
>
> When it happens, the user is welcomed to use `items update` command instead.
